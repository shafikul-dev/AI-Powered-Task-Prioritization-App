## ‚ö° Quick Start

1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-powered-task-prioritization-app
```

2. Configure environments
```bash
# Backend (AI keys and port)
cp backend/env.example backend/.env
# Set one of: OPENAI_API_KEY / GEMINI_API_KEY / ANTHROPIC_API_KEY / GROQ_API_KEY

# Client (API URL for the backend)
cp client/env.example client/.env
# In client/.env set:
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

3. Install and run both apps
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

4. Open the apps
- Client (Vite): http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:3000
- Health check: http://localhost:3000/api/health

5. Prioritize tasks
- Add tasks in the UI and click "Prioritize Tasks".

### Notes
- Default AI service in `backend/server.js` is `groq`. Ensure the matching API key is set in `backend/.env`.
- You can switch providers by changing `AI_SERVICE` in `backend/server.js` and adding the corresponding key in `.env`.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have:

1. **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
2. **npm** (Node Package Manager)
3. **An AI API Key** from one of the supported providers:
   - OpenAI API key
   - Google Gemini API key
   - Anthropic Claude API key

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-powered-task-prioritization-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Copy the example environment file and configure your API key:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and add your AI API key:

```env
# For OpenAI (recommended)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# For Google Gemini (alternative)
# GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# For Anthropic Claude (alternative)
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
```

### 4. Start the Application

#### Development (Recommended)
```bash
# Installs backend and client automatically, then runs both with hot reload
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Production (One possible approach)
```bash
# Build the client from /client and serve separately, or add static hosting via Express
cd client && npm run build && cd ..
# Start backend (ensure it knows where to serve the built assets if you choose to serve from Express)
cd backend && npm start
```

### 5. Access the Application
Open your browser and navigate to:
```
Client:   http://localhost:5173
Backend:  http://localhost:3000
```

## üîß Configuration

### AI Service Selection
The application supports multiple AI providers. To switch between them, modify the `AI_SERVICE` variable in `server.js`:

```javascript
const AI_SERVICE = 'openai'; // Change to 'gemini', 'anthropic', or 'groq'
```

### API Key Setup

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"AI API key not configured" error**
   - Ensure your `.env` file exists and contains a valid API key
   - Check that the API key is correctly named (OPENAI_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)

2. **"Failed to prioritize tasks" error**
   - Verify your API key is valid and has sufficient credits
   - Check your internet connection
   - Ensure the AI service is operational

3. **Tasks not saving**
   - Check if localStorage is enabled in your browser
   - Clear browser cache and try again

4. **Server won't start**
   - Ensure Node.js is installed (version 14+)
   - Run `npm install` to install dependencies
   - Check that port 3000 is available

### Debug Mode
To enable debug logging, set the NODE_ENV environment variable:
```bash
NODE_ENV=development npm start
